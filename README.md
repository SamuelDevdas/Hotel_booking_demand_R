# Hotel Booking Demand EDA
## Introduction
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle. The aim of this project is to explore the relationship between the various variables in the dataset and to create meaningful visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

## Data Description
The dataset contains 119,390 records of hotel booking information. Each record includes information such as the hotel type (City Hotel or Resort Hotel), arrival date, departure date, number of adults, number of children, etc. The target variable, "adr" (average daily rate), represents the average price of a room per night.

## Project Outline
The following topics have been covered in this EDA project:

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data Overview and Summary Statistics
Visualizing the Relationships between Variables
Comparing Average Daily Rates between City Hotels and Resort Hotels
Time Series Analysis of Number of Bookings

## Conclusion
This EDA project provides a comprehensive overview of the Hotel Booking Demand dataset and helps to understand the trends and patterns in the data. Through the visualizations and analysis, some insights have been gained into the factors that affect the average daily rate and the number of bookings.

## Tools and Technologies
This project has been developed using R programming language and R Studio as the integrated development environment. The following libraries have been used:

ggplot2
dplyr
lubridate
tidyr

## How to Run
To run this project, you will need to have R and R Studio installed on your computer. Then, you can clone the repository to your local machine and open the .Rmd file in R Studio. Run the code chunks in the file to reproduce the results of the EDA.
